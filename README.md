 ## FalconCV

FalconCV is an open-source python library that offers developers an interface to interact with some of the most popular computer vision frameworks, such as Tensorflow Object detection API and Detectron. The main objective behind it is to unify the set of tools available and simplify the use of them. This library is focused mainly on Computer Vision practitioners but also is flexible enough to allow researchers to configure the models at a low-level. Additionally, taking advantage of the fantastic features that OpenVINO offers, a custom model can be trained and optimized to run efficiently in the target hardware with just a few lines of code. It is important to say that FalconCV does not attempt to replace any of the tools mentioned previously; instead, it takes the best of them and offers a solution to improve accessibility to new users.
